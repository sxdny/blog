I present to you: Tazk! A new iOS app for managing your daily tasks.

I went tired of learning the Swift basics with very simple projects, so I decided to create something. I'm not a designer, so I'm using the default components from UIKit. I'll be focusing on the functionality and the code, but I'll try to make it look good because if It doesn't look good, at least for me, it's not an iOS app.

# Why Tazk?

I'm creating Tazk because I really want to make something simple and useful, and I think that a task manager is the best way to start. There's a lot of apps out there that requires you to pay a stupid amount of money only to add more tasks or to put them into folders or some stupid things.

I can also use the app on my daily life and that's cool.

# Features

Right now, the app allows you to add a new task and mark it as done:

You can add a new task with the top right button. By the moment, the app only allows you to add a task with a name. Just ignore the rest of the fields because they are not implemented yet.

That's it. I know that is a impressive amount of features but I'm still working on the app and I'll be adding more very soon.

My plan is to implement:

- Add a due date to a task
- Categories
- Priorities (low, medium, high and urgent)
- Notifications
- Calendar view
- A way to gamefy the tasks

So I'll be working on it and I'll be posting my progress here. Stay tuned!
